special tile ideas:

- blank, which can be any letter, even different letters in horiz vs. vert
- "glue" tile which acts like the empty string when computing word-ness, so like
```
        A
        B
  B E A * C O N
        L
        E
```
is allowed.

- multi-character tiles, e.g.
```
         A
         G
      M [IL] I T A R Y
         E
```

bonus ideas:

- temporarily slow down letter arrival
- give 'bombs' to destroy obstacles
- force next letter to be vowel/consonant/etc.
- destroy letter
- turn letter into vowel/consonant/etc.
- increment/decrement letter in alphabet
- duplicate letter
- temporary stashing of letters

constraints:

- barriers that have to be bombed
- you have to capture it with a vowel/consonant/etc.
- you have to capture it with a sufficiently long word
- you have to capture it with a sufficiently short word
